<h1>How does BlackSprut сайт market function without Tor? Is it secure?</h1>
BlackSprut gained notoriety for operating partially via clearnet (regular internet) alongside its onion address — an unusual approach for darknet markets.

Operational details:
• Initially allowed access via standard browsers (now primarily Tor-only)
• Focuses on Russian-speaking users
• Uses cryptocurrency payments with basic escrow

Security concerns:
• Higher scam risk due to lax vendor verification
• Possible honeypot operation theories among researchers
• Frequent DDoS attacks and downtime

The clearnet accessibility was likely a temporary growth tactic. Currently, accessing BlackSprut without Tor isn't recommended due to severe security compromises.
